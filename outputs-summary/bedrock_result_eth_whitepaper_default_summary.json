What Ethereum intends to provide is a blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language that can be used to create \"contracts\" that can be used to encode arbitrary state transition functions, allowing users to create any of the systems described above, as well as many others that we have not yet imagined, simply by writing up the logic in a few lines of code.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe intent of Ethereum is to merge together and improve upon the concepts of scripting, altcoins, and on-chain meta-protocols, and allow developers to create arbitrary consensus-based applications that have the scalability, standardization, feature-completeness, ease of development, and interoperability offered by these different paradigms all at the same time.
